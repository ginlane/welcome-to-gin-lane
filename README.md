#### This repository will serve as a place for:

* Reusable code snippets
* A development styleguide (see "Wiki") to standardise our codebase
* A place for on-boarding new developers and getting them up to speed with the tools, plugins & mixins we use

**Please organise your code by its language, then identifier, such as "js-360", "coffee-async" or "scss-mixins".  If it is multiple languages, try be descriptive, EG: "haml_scss_coffee-boilerplate".**

This is a living, breathing codebase and wiki.  If you feel like it should be updated / changed, pull down the repo, make your changes, and push!  Be as detailed as you can in the Commit Summary as to what you changed, and why.

When updating the Wiki, try to reference an article or justification.  It's a good chance for us to all learn better practices at the same time!

**Note:** Please seperate large codebases, apps and huge assets from this repo.  This is a place for small snippets and quickly re-usable stuff.
